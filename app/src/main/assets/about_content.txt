“Augmented School” application is developed to provide an interactive learning with Augmented Reality for preschool children. Our application is AR-Optional that means designed for both non-AR and AR supported devices. The application serves three services: -
1.	Learn
2.	Test and
3.	Scan book (Works only for AR supported devices).

Learn: In this section, the app introduces (teaches) to preschool children some basic subjects (i.e. স্বরবর্ণ, ব্যঞ্জনবর্ণ, সংখ্যা, Alphabets, Numbers and Animals) by listening names and showing associated pictures and names (If necessary) one by one by pressing a navigation button. For every item of every learn there are available an AR view button (Works only for AR supported devices) to view the item in real world by opening the camera of device.

Test: In this section, the application gets test from the preschool children which they have already learned from the Learn section. Every Test contains a set of Test pages based on the number of the Test items. Each test page holds four items to choose a correct one with playing a voice that need to choose. The examinee gets a wrong warning if the clicked item is not correct. After clicked a correct one the test page proceeds to the next one. The process is continuing until the rest of the items. All the wrong and correct answer are tracking to make a Test result.

Scan book: In this section, the app scans an item (s) for a particular subject from a dedicated Augmented Reality based book for this app to render the 3D model of the scanned item on the top of it. While a user scans an item form the book the application is trying to detect the scanning image. Once the image is detected then it’s proceeds to tracked the image to render a single or multiple 3D model (s) for each scanned item on the top of it. Note that this feature works only for AR supported devices.
